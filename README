This is myScotchbook.  
It is my class project for Code Louisville in the fall of 2017.  
It was created because I have a passion for scotch and wanted a log of
the various tastings I have. This is my long-term project and this is only the front end of it.
It is using the bootstrap framework.  I have altered the header and footer using an external css file. 
The "A new dram" page is th eform that doesnt subit because it has nowhere to go.
